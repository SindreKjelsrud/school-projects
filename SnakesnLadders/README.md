# SnakesnLadders

## Info

This was an assignment in the DAT109 course. We were assigned to model and program the traditional Indian board game "snakes and ladders".

This assignment was made to help us practice the following things:

- Practice developing a program from idea to product.
- Practice understanding a requirements specification and creating a model that matches the requirements.
- Practice using object-oriented principles and design patterns to create a solution.

The report will contain our workflow, the different diagrams and models made, and some screenshots of our code and project structure.

We made two versions of the game, one of them can be played in the terminal and the other on the web. We used Spring for the web-version.

## What I've learned from the project

- How to develop a program from idea to product
  - Involves plandrawings of the projects structure, documentation and writing tests
- How to structure an application from scratch as a group
- Getting an understanding of a requirements specification
- Practicing usage of OOP and design patterns to create a solution
- The usage of Scrum and Kanban boards

## What could've been done differently

- Plan better from the start
  - Involves setting up the project structure in a way that makes it easier to work together as a group
