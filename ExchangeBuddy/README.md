# Exchange Buddy

# Info

This was an assignment in the DAT109 course. We were assigned to model and program a web-application, where we could choose our own project idea. Our idea was based on finn.no and hybel.no, where students going abroad could find other people to share apartments with so that it would be easier to find a place to live while abroad.

This project was made to help us practice and master the following things:

- Agile methods (AUP combined with Scrum) as a development process.
  - Part of this consists of us grasping and perceiving what wishes and needs the customer has, and that we master the technology and manage to deliver one application of good quality and are able to document and reflect on it.

The report will contain a summary for each iteration.

To make this project as efficient as possible where we avoid the issues of several people working on the same task, we have made it so that the groups workflow for each iteration consists of online kanban boards.  
The kanban board also helped us sort out the tasks with different colored tags that would help us see what type of task each task was.

## What I've learned from the project

- How to develop a fullstack application in a large team
- How to connect frontend and backend
- The importance of Agile methods as a development process

## What could've been done differently

- Should've research more on React / SpringBoot applications
- Fully design the website before coding frontend
- Structure the group better
  - Both the distribution of tasks and responsibilities (more something like A-leadership)
- Better logging, as this could've helped the group get a better oversight of what's happening in the group, who's responsible for what, and when things need to be done.
