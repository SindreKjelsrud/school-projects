# CarRental

## Info

This was an assignment in the DAT109 course. We were assigned to model and program an web-application for a car-rental company that wants to establish in Norway with a rental office in all the big
cities, as well as at all the big airports.  
The rental offices will rent out and receive cars in return after users have rented it.

This assignment was made to help us practice the following things:

- Practice developing a program from idea to product.
- Practice understanding a requirements specification and creating a model that matches the requirements.
- Practice using object-oriented principles and design patterns to create a solution.

The report will contain our workflow, the different diagrams and models made, and some screenshots of our code and project structure.

## What I've learned from the project

- How to develop a program from idea to product
  - Involves plandrawings of the projects structure, documentation and writing tests
- How to structure an application from scratch as a group
- Getting an understanding of a requirements specification
- Practicing usage of OOP and design patterns to create a solution
- How difficult UI/UX design can be without using libraries
- How difficult it can be to structure code when there is a lot of controllers and so on.
- The usage of Scrum and Kanban boards

## What could've been done differently

- Plan the layout from the start
- Make fewer controllers
- Use frontend libraries
- Make code and project structure more readable
