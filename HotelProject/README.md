# DAT154 - Assignment 4

## Info

This was an assignment in the DAT154 course. We were assigned to create 3 different apps in a (mostly) working condition for a hotel management system.

The 3 apps were a web application for customers to book rooms and check the status og their reservation, a desktop application used by the front desk to have full access to all rooms and reservations, and an application used by the cleaning, service and maintenance personnel to display a list of pending tasks.

A requirement was to use .NET technologies, were we chose ASP.NET, WinForms & WPF. The apps communicated with each through a Azure database, using frameworks like EntityFrameworkCore.

## What I've learned from the project

- How .NET technologies, like WPF, work
- How frameworks, like EntityFrameworkCore, works
- Usage of databases and models in C#
